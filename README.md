# bestbuybot
Bot to buy the RTX 3080 (or anything) on bestbuy.com

Need to add a python file called info.py and add string variables like:
email="test@gmail.com"
for your email, password, and CVV so it can place those fields into the appropiate checkout boxes

You can replace the "item" variable with the link to the page of whatever you want to run the bot for (PS5 for example)

Look into the selenium python library for details on how everything works, or if you need to alter anything
